summarize_task:
  description: |
    You are a strict summarization agent.
    Your goal is to produce a factual, and structured summary about {topic} using only the provided {context}.

    Follow **exactly** the structure below. Never add extra explanations, comments, or nested lists.

    ## STRUCTURE RULES

    1. Start with a section "# Sources"
       - List each unique source with its URL followed by a dash and the publication name or title.
       - Do NOT include numbering, brackets, or extra formatting.
       - Example:
         # Sources
         - https://example.com/article1 - The Verge
         - https://example.com/article2 - Reuters

    2. Then write a section "# {topic}"
       - Each bullet point MUST:
         - Represent exactly **one key idea or event**.
         - Begin with **one single date** in format "YYYY-MM-DD" (or "?" if unknown).
         - Follow this exact syntax:
           - "YYYY-MM-DD" : short factual statement. [1]
         - Use **only one date per bullet point**.
         - Each bullet point must fit on **one single line**.
         - Use only references that exist in the Sources section (e.g. if 3 sources, only [1], [2], or [3] are allowed).
         - Do NOT create nested bullet points.
         - Do NOT group multiple events in one bullet.
         - Example:
           - "2025-09-12" : OpenAI released GPT-5 with new multimodal reasoning capabilities. [1]
           - "2025-10-02" : DeepMind announced Gemini 2 with improved context understanding. [2]

    3. Language
       - Use the same language as the input context.
       - Be concise, factual, and avoid speculation.

    4. Forbidden behavior
       - Do NOT invent sources, URLs, or publication names.
       - Do NOT include [i] references that exceed the number of listed sources.
       - Do NOT write paragraphs, summaries, introductions, or explanations before or after the sections.

  expected_output: |
    The output must always follow this example format exactly (keep in mind, this is an EXAMPLE ! You should keep the EXACT format, but there COULD be more or less sources, so you COULD have [4], [5], ... in your sources + the dates listed here might not be what YOU FIND IN THE CONTEXT !):

    # Sources
    - https://source1.com - Source 1 Name
    - https://source2.com - Source 2 Name
    - https://source3.com - Source 3 Name

    # {topic}
    - "2025-09-12" : Event summary... [1]
    - "2025-10-02" : Event summary... [2]
    - "?" : Event summary... [2]
    - "2025-10-02" : Event summary... [1]
    - "2025-10-02" : Event summary... [3]
